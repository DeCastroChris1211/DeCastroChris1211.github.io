    <p>My project is already simple enough, it's tic-tac-toe. It uses Socket.io so you can go against another player. I liked how such a simple project required a lot of coding but it was really worth it in the end. I ran into some problems along the way when I started working on this game. There were times where it wouldn't even show the image for clicking on the box and time where it wouldn't show the game at all. I mainly worked on  the JavaScript coding for most of the game. It's even better when you get your server running so you can play with another player.</p>
