    <p>I volunteered to become a spectator for America's Got Talent. I was really interested in it because it was all for free and everyone could see it and enjoy it while supporting our club at the same time. I enjoyed it because I get to meet the judges and watch the incredible acts. I didn't win anything out of it but we gained money for it to support our club. One of my favorite acts was when this man tried to scare a volunteer but it became too obvious for everyone to know. </p>
