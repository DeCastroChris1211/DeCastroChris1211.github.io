    <p>Hi! My name is Christian De Castro and I'm a very energetic, positive, and a helpful person. I'm also an excellent learner but I also need time for me to understand what I'm learning sometimes. I've volunteered in many fundraising activities with the Class of 2019 club. My favorite class is my Web Development class in the APP academy. It's my favorite class because I get to make simple games and websites from using coding programs and show it off to my friends. </p>
