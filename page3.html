    <p>For my project I had to make a sonnet for English. The sonnet contained 14 lines and it had to be based on a simple topic and should be used with more than 12 rhymes. I chose it because I'm not that good at making rhymes but, I was really proud for making it. The hardest part was picking a topic. As soon as I found my topic, I realised how easy it was when I reached the requirement so fast.</p>
